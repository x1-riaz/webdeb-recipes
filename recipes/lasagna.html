    <p>Lasagna (also known as lasagne) is a type of pasta made from very wide, flat sheets. Itâ€™s possibly one of the oldest pasta types. The dish consists of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragÃ¹ (ground meats and tomato sauce), bÃ©chamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings. The assembled ingredients are then baked in an oven, resulting in a delicious, hearty meal. ðŸ˜Š</p>
